# LoanApprovalPrediction
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using Machine Learning techniques. The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to gain insights and prepare the data for modeling. The RidgeClassifier model is applied to classify loan applications and predict approvals.

Key steps include:

Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values.
Detailed data analysis and visualizations to understand patterns and trends.
Training and testing the RidgeClassifier model to improve accuracy in predictions.
This project is valuable for financial institutions aiming to streamline their loan approval process using predictive analytics.
